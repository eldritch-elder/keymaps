# keymaps

This repo is my approach to code my keymaps using literate programming.
To get started, you need the following:

- Something capable for parsing `org` including `babel`
  - `emacs` is recommended
- A workable toolchain for `qmk`
  - TODO: add `kmonad` and `zmk`. Maybe.
  
That's it, you don't need anything else.
